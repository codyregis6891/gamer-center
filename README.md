"For gamers, by gamers"
Below are the basic details of features we plan on implementing into our application:
--A videogame blog/community/marketplace featuring;
	--Game reviews
	--Game ratings (site rating and user rating, similar to IMDB)
	--FAQ/Walkthroughs
	--Marketplace for games, equipment, etc.
	--Videos of gameplay/preview of game
	--Login feature to allow access to marketplace & the ability to engage in dialog/reviewing games
While we each plan on contributing and collaborating throughout the entirety of the project, we have loosely assigned the following task to each member:
	--Erick will be heading the back-end functions
	--Edward will be heading the layout, UI, responsiveness
	--Cody will be heading the front-end javascript functionality
