## Description

As gamers we are tired of visiting sites that are funded or influenced by the companies/studios that make these games.
We want to help gamers with an unbiased all in one place to review games, buy/sell games & equipment, and interact with other gamers.
We want to create a place where gamers feel like gamers, NOT consumers.
